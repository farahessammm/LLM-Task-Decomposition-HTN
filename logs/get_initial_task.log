Be ruthless about getting rid of items that are broken, no longer needed, or haven't been used in a while.
2. **Categorize and Group**: Once you've purged your unwanted items, group like items together (e.g., all clothes, all books, all paperwork, etc.). Within each group, categorize items into sub-groups (e.g., clothes: tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, etc.). This will make it easier to see what you have and where it should go.
3. **Assign a Home**: Now that you've grouped and categorized your items, assign a designated spot for each group or sub-group. Put things back in their assigned homes, making sure everything has a designated place and is easily accessible. This might involve using storage containers, bins, or baskets to keep items organized and out of sight.
