Since the goal is not explicitly defined, I'll assume it's a generic task node. 

The current state is "You are in a cluttered bedroom", but the goal is not specified. Without more information about the goal, I cannot determine if the current state satisfies the goal.

However, if the goal is to be in a cluttered bedroom, then the answer would be 'True'. If the goal is something else, such as having a clean bedroom, then the answer would be 'False'.

Please provide more information about the goal for a more accurate answer.
